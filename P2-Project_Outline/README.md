## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a home inventory app that will allow users to store information regarding their property. Users will be able to create an account, log in, choose a location type (home, business, storage unit), create, edit, and remove the rooms associated with their chosen location, and create, edit, and remove the items in each room. They will be able to store information including the manufacturer, serial numbers, purchase price, and date purchased for the item created. They will be able to view items by room, as well as the totals for number of items and purchase cost of all items.

I decided to make this project because I have had a home I lived in damaged by fire, and have had my current home burglarized. I have found that when you try to deal with insurance claims from memory you are likely to lose out on money that is due to you. This app would save the information in the cloud, providing access to it that would likely not be available from local storage.
### Features
User Sign up: Users will be able to create an account using a unique username, email address, and password.
User Login: Users will be able to login after creating an account. Passwords will be hashed and salted.
Users will choose a location from a dropdown menu (home, business, storage unit).
Edit, Create, and Delete Rooms: Users will be able to create new rooms to associate with item locations.
Edit, Create, and Delete Items: Users will be able to create new items stored according to their locations.
View Items: Users will be able to see a full listing of items by room.
### Technologies
Javascript
React
Express
MongoDB or Firebird

### What I'll Have to Learn
I am new to all of these technologies, so I will have to learn how to write a full-stack javascript app.
